# ✅ Product Model Improvements - COMPLETE!

## 🎉 Your Question Answered

**You asked:** _"I need to finish my project and deploy. I think I don't have a price column which is not correct. How can I improve my product model?"_

## ✅ THE ANSWER

### Your Pricing is CORRECT! ✨

You **DON'T need** a price column in the Product model. You're using the **professional approach**:

```python
# ✅ CORRECT (Your current structure)
Product → has many SKUs → each SKU has its own price

Example:
Product: "Nike Air Max"
├── SKU: Size 40, Black → Price: 5000
├── SKU: Size 41, Black → Price: 5000
├── SKU: Size 40, White → Price: 5500
└── SKU: Size 41, White → Price: 5500

Display Price: 5000 (minimum)
```

This is how **Amazon, Nike, Adidas, and all major e-commerce sites** do it!

## 🚀 What We Improved
