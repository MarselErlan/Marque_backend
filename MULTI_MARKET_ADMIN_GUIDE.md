## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Authentication Flow

1. **Login Form** → Admin enters credentials + selects market
2. **Market Validation** → System validates market selection
3. **Database Check** → Credentials checked only in selected market DB
4. **Session Creation** → Session stores market context
5. **Admin Panel** → All operations use correct database

### Session Data Stored

```python
request.session.update({
    "token": token,
    "admin_id": admin.id,
    "admin_username": admin.username,
    "is_super_admin": admin.is_super_admin,
    "admin_market": market.value,           # "kg" or "us"
    "market_currency": market_config["currency"],
    "market_country": market_config["country"],
    "market_language": market_config["language"]
})
```

### Database Access

```python
# Get market from session
admin_market = request.session.get("admin_market", "kg")
market = Market.KG if admin_market == "kg" else Market.US

# Get database session for selected market
db = next(db_manager.get_db_session(market))
```
