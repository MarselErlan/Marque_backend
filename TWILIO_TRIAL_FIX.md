# üî¥ Twilio Trial Account Issue

## Problem

You're getting the same code "096703" because:

1. ‚úÖ Twilio Verify API is working (Status 201 - SMS sent)
2. ‚ùå But you're NOT receiving the SMS on your phone
3. ‚ùå When verification fails, our code falls back to demo mode
4. ‚ùå Demo mode generates the same code from database

## Root Cause: Twilio Trial Account Restrictions

**Twilio Trial accounts can ONLY send SMS to verified phone numbers!**

## üöÄ Quick Fix

### Step 1: Verify Your Phone Number in Twilio

1. Go to **Twilio Console**: https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/phone-numbers/manage/verified
2. Click **"Verify a Caller ID"** or **"Add a new Caller ID"**
3. Enter your phone number: **+13128059851**
4. Twilio will send you a verification code via SMS
5. Enter that code to verify your number

### Step 2: Test Again

After verifying your number, test the API:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://marquebackend-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/auth/send-verification" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phone": "+13128059851"}' | jq '.'
```

**You should now receive a REAL SMS with a RANDOM code!** üì±

## Alternative: Upgrade Twilio Account

If you need to send to any phone number (not just verified ones):

1. Go to: https://console.twilio.com/billing/upgrade
2. Add payment method
3. Upgrade from Trial to Paid account
4. Cost: ~$0.0075 per SMS (very cheap)

## How to Check if Your Account is Trial

1. Go to: https://console.twilio.com/
2. Look for **red banner** at the top saying "Trial Account"
3. Or check: https://console.twilio.com/billing

## Why You See "096703"

When Twilio SMS fails to send (because number not verified), our code:

1. Falls back to demo mode
2. Creates a verification code in database
3. That database code is deterministic based on timestamp
4. So you see the same code "096703" in the response
5. But you never receive an SMS

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Before (Trial + Unverified Number):

```
API Response: "success": true
Your Phone: ‚ùå No SMS received
Database: Code "096703" created
```

### After (Verified Number):

```
API Response: "success": true
Your Phone: ‚úÖ SMS with random code "482916"
Twilio: Code stored in Twilio Verify
Database: Not used (Twilio handles it)
```

---

## Test with Verified Number

Once verified, each request will give you a NEW random code:

```bash
# Request 1
{"verification_code": "123456"}  # Random

# Request 2
{"verification_code": "789012"}  # Different random

# Request 3
{"verification_code": "345678"}  # Different random
```

---

## Verify Your Setup

Run this to check Twilio logs:

```bash
# Check if SMS was delivered
https://console.twilio.com/us1/monitor/logs/sms
```

Look for:

- ‚úÖ **Status: Delivered** (SMS received)
- ‚ùå **Status: Failed** (need to verify number)
