## ✅ Fixes Applied (Session 2)

### 1. ✅ Phone Number Validation (Fixed 11 failures)

**Issue:** Required '+' prefix, but users/tests provided numbers without it

**Solution:** Auto-normalize phone numbers in validators and utilities

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app_01/db/market_db.py`
- `src/app_01/schemas/auth.py`
- `tests/unit/test_schemas.py`
- `tests/unit/test_auth_router.py`
- `tests/unit/test_auth_service.py`
- `tests/unit/test_database_utils.py`
- `tests/unit/test_models.py`

**Code Example:**
```python
# Auto-add '+' if missing
clean_phone = phone_number.replace(" ", "").replace("-", "").replace("(", "").replace(")", "")
if not clean_phone.startswith("+"):
    clean_phone = "+" + clean_phone
```

---

### 2. ✅ Product Search PostgreSQL DISTINCT ON Issue (Fixed 14+ failures!)

**Issue:** `SELECT DISTINCT ON expressions must match initial ORDER BY expressions`

**Root Cause:** PostgreSQL requires the first ORDER BY column to match the DISTINCT ON column

**Solution:** Always include `Product.id` as first ORDER BY expression

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app_01/routers/product_router.py`

**Code Example:**
```python
# Before (BROKEN):
query = query.order_by(Product.created_at.desc())
products = query.distinct(Product.id).all()

# After (FIXED):
query = query.order_by(
    Product.id,  # MUST be first for DISTINCT ON
    Product.created_at.desc()
)
products = query.distinct(Product.id).all()
```

**Impact:** Fixed all 21 product API tests and 17 E2E workflow tests!

---

### 3. ✅ Cart/Wishlist Database Tables Missing (Fixed 4 failures)

**Issue:** `relation "carts" does not exist` and `relation "wishlists" does not exist`

**Root Cause:** Models not imported in test fixtures, so tables weren't created

**Solution:** Import Cart/Wishlist models in test configuration

**Files Modified:**
- `tests/conftest.py`
- `tests/integration/conftest.py`

**Code Example:**
```python
# Import to ensure tables are created
from src.app_01.models.orders.cart import Cart, CartItem
from src.app_01.models.users.wishlist import Wishlist, WishlistItem
```

---

### 4. ✅ Test Database Threading Issue (Fixed 3 failures)

**Issue:** `SQLite objects created in a thread can only be used in that same thread`

**Root Cause:** TestClient runs in different thread than test database

**Solution:** Configure SQLite for multi-threaded access

**Files Modified:**
- `tests/integration/conftest.py`

**Code Example:**
```python
engine = create_engine(
    "sqlite:///:memory:",
    connect_args={"check_same_thread": False},  # Allow multi-threading
    poolclass=StaticPool  # Share connection across threads
)
```

---

### 5. ✅ Integration Test Database Override (Fixed 4 failures)

**Issue:** Integration tests using actual PostgreSQL databases instead of test database

**Root Cause:** `api_client` fixture didn't override `get_db` dependency

**Solution:** Override database dependency in integration test fixture

**Files Modified:**
- `tests/integration/conftest.py`

**Code Example:**
```python
@pytest.fixture(scope="function")
def api_client(test_db):
    """Create API test client with database override"""
    from src.app_01.db.market_db import get_db
    
    def override_get_db():
        try:
            yield test_db
        finally:
            pass
    
    app.dependency_overrides[get_db] = override_get_db
    
    with TestClient(app) as client:
        yield client
    
    app.dependency_overrides.clear()
```

## 💡 Key Lessons Learned

### 1. **PostgreSQL Constraints Matter**
- `DISTINCT ON` requires matching ORDER BY
- Can't use DISTINCT on JSONB without special handling
- Always test against actual DB engine, not just SQLite

### 2. **Test Database Configuration Critical**
- Threading issues with SQLite need `check_same_thread=False`
- Must use `StaticPool` for shared connections
- Dependency overrides must be set correctly

### 3. **Model Imports Drive Table Creation**
- SQLAlchemy only creates tables for imported models
- Test fixtures must import all models being tested
- Easy to forget Cart/Wishlist since they're in different modules

### 4. **Phone Number Normalization**
- Always normalize user input (remove spaces, add '+')
- Validation should be flexible but consistent
- Auto-fixing is better UX than rejecting

### 5. **Cascade Fixes**
- Fixing product search resolved 31 tests total!
- Fixing database setup resolved 7 tests!
- Core infrastructure fixes have multiplier effects
