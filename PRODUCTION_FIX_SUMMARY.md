# 🚨 Production Error Fix Summary

## What Happened

Your production API at Railway is returning:

```json
{
  "error": "http_error",
  "message": "column users.market does not exist",
  "status_code": 500
}
```

## Root Cause

**The production PostgreSQL database schema is outdated.**

Your code expects these columns in the `users` table:

- ✅ `id`
- ✅ `phone_number`
- ✅ `full_name`
- ❌ `market` ← **MISSING**
- ❌ `language` ← **MISSING**
- ❌ `country` ← **MISSING**
- ❌ `is_active` ← **MISSING (maybe)**
- ❌ `is_verified` ← **MISSING (maybe)**

But the production database still has the OLD schema from before you implemented multi-market support.

## 🎯 The Fix (Choose One)

### Option 1: Automatic Fix (Recommended)

**Your Procfile has been updated to auto-migrate!**

Just push to GitHub and Railway will automatically run migrations:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: add auto-migration on deployment"
git push origin main
```

Railway will now run:

1. `alembic upgrade head` (migrations)
2. `uvicorn src.app_01.main:app ...` (start server)

### Option 2: Manual Fix (Immediate)

Run migrations manually using Railway CLI:

```bash
# Install Railway CLI (if not installed)
npm i -g @railway/cli

# Login and link to your project
railway login
railway link

# Run the migration script
./railway_migrate.sh

# Or run directly
railway run alembic upgrade head
```

## 📁 Files Created/Updated

### New Files

1. **`PRODUCTION_DATABASE_FIX.md`** - Complete troubleshooting guide
2. **`railway_migrate.sh`** - Script to run migrations on Railway
3. **`start_production.sh`** - Production startup script with migrations
4. **`verify_production_db.py`** - Script to verify database schema

### Updated Files

1. **`Procfile`** - Now includes automatic migrations

   ```
   release: alembic upgrade head
   web: uvicorn src.app_01.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
   ```

2. **`README.md`** - Added deployment & migration instructions

---

## 🔧 How to Use the New Scripts

### 1. Verify Database Schema

```bash
# Check if production DB is ready
python verify_production_db.py
```

Output will show:

- ✅ Green: Column exists
- ❌ Red: Column missing (needs migration)

### 2. Run Migrations

```bash
# Run migrations for both markets
./railway_migrate.sh

# Or individually
./railway_migrate.sh US    # US market only
./railway_migrate.sh KG    # KG market only
```

### 3. Start Production Server Locally

```bash
# Test the full startup process
./start_production.sh
```

This script:

1. Runs KG database migrations
2. Runs US database migrations
3. Starts the server

## 📊 Migration Status

Your project has **6 migrations** that need to be applied:

| Migration      | Description                    | Status     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------- |
| `71d0a21d5609` | Initial multi-market migration | ⏳ Pending |
| `1d198e139e13` | Align models with frontend     | ⏳ Pending |
| `0ca8b2ef41f8` | Add original_price to SKU      | ⏳ Pending |
| `6994966bbf08` | Add banners table              | ⏳ Pending |
| `7371bc5cd7ba` | Add cart models                | ⏳ Pending |
| `88ebdddde521` | Add wishlist models            | ⏳ Pending |

**After running migrations, all will show ✅ Applied**

---

## ✅ Verification Steps

After applying the fix:

### 1. Test Send Verification Endpoint

```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/v1/auth/send-verification" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phone": "+13128059851"}'
```

**Expected Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Verification code sent successfully",
  "phone_number": "+1 (312) 805-9851",
  "market": "us",
  "language": "en",
  "expires_in_minutes": 15
}
```

### 2. Check Railway Logs

```bash
railway logs
```

Should show:

```
🔄 Running database migrations...
✅ Alembic migrations completed
🚀 Starting production server...
```

### 3. Test Both Markets

**US Number:**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/v1/auth/send-verification" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phone": "+13128059851"}'
```

**KG Number:**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/v1/auth/send-verification" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phone": "+996555123456"}'
```

Both should work! ✅

## 🌍 Database Architecture

Your production needs **TWO separate PostgreSQL databases**:

### KG Market Database

- **Env Var:** `DATABASE_URL_MARQUE_KG`
- **For:** Kyrgyzstan users (+996)
- **Tables:** users, products, skus, carts, etc.

### US Market Database

- **Env Var:** `DATABASE_URL_MARQUE_US`
- **For:** US users (+1)
- **Tables:** users, products, skus, carts, etc.

Make sure both are configured in Railway!

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Error: "Railway CLI not found"

```bash
npm i -g @railway/cli
railway login
railway link
```

### Error: "Database URL not found"

Check Railway dashboard:

- Go to your project
- Check "Variables" tab
- Ensure `DATABASE_URL_MARQUE_KG` and `DATABASE_URL_MARQUE_US` exist

### Error: "Multiple heads detected"

```bash
alembic heads  # Check migration tree
alembic merge -m "merge heads" <head1> <head2>
alembic upgrade head
```

### Error: "Permission denied"

Make sure scripts are executable:

```bash
chmod +x railway_migrate.sh
chmod +x start_production.sh
chmod +x verify_production_db.py
```

---

## 🎉 Success Criteria

You'll know it's fixed when:

1. ✅ No more "column users.market does not exist" errors
2. ✅ `/send-verification` returns 200 for +1 numbers
3. ✅ `/send-verification` returns 200 for +996 numbers
4. ✅ Response includes `"market": "us"` or `"market": "kg"`
5. ✅ Railway logs show "Database migrations completed"
6. ✅ Users can complete full auth flow (send → verify → get token)

## 💡 Prevention for Next Time

**With the updated Procfile:**

- Migrations run automatically on every deployment
- No manual intervention needed
- Safe for future schema changes

**Best Practices:**

1. Always test migrations locally first
2. Keep migrations in version control
3. Document schema changes
4. Run `verify_production_db.py` before deploying
5. Monitor Railway logs after deployment

---

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Run migrations using Option 1 or 2
2. **Verify:** Test endpoints with Postman
3. **Deploy:** Push updated Procfile to GitHub
4. **Monitor:** Watch Railway logs for any issues
5. **Document:** Update team on new deployment process
