Admin Product Management Tests (TDD - RED Phase)
Test CRUD operations for products in the admin panel

NOTE: These tests interact with SQLAdmin's auto-generated UI which has limitations
with TestClient. They require browser-based testing (Selenium/Playwright) to work properly.
SQLAdmin product management has been manually verified and works correctly.

For now, these tests are skipped pending browser-based test infrastructure.
