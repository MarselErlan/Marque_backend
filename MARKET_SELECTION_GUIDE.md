## 🔧 Technical Details

### How Database Switching Works

```python
# When admin saves a product:

1. Admin selects market in UI → market stored in session
   request.session['selected_market'] = 'kg'  # or 'us'

2. Admin clicks "Save Product"

3. System reads selected market from session
   market = get_current_market(request)  # Returns Market.KG

4. System gets correct database session
   db = db_manager.get_session_factory(market)()

5. Product saved to correct database
   db.add(product)
   db.commit()

Result: Product in KG database only! ✅
```

### Session Variables

```python
After login:
{
    'token': 'abc123...',
    'admin_id': 1,
    'admin_username': 'admin',
    'is_super_admin': True,
    'admin_market': 'kg',  # Database where admin account exists
    'selected_market': 'kg'  # Currently selected market for operations
}

After switching to US:
{
    ...
    'selected_market': 'us'  # Changed to US!
}
```

### Market Middleware

```python
MarketMiddleware:
- Intercepts all admin requests
- Checks if market is selected
- Sets default market if not set
- Ensures smooth operation
```

### Market-Aware Views

All admin views now use the selected market:

- ProductAdmin → Uses selected market DB
- CategoryAdmin → Uses selected market DB
- OrderAdmin → Uses selected market DB
- ALL views → Market-aware! ✅
