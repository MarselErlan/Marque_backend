# ✅ Simple Setup - Railway Database Only

## What We Did

Configured your app to use **ONLY Railway database** for everything.

---

## 🎯 One Task: Add This to Railway

Go to: https://railway.app/dashboard

1. Click your project
2. Click your **App Service**
3. Click **Variables** tab
4. Add this variable (if not exists):

```
Name: DATABASE_URL_MARQUE_US
Value: ${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}
```

5. Click **Add** or **Save**
6. Railway will auto-deploy (~2 min)

**That's it!** ✅

---

## ✅ What This Does

```
Before:
  DATABASE_URL_MARQUE_KG → Railway DB ✅
  DATABASE_URL_MARQUE_US → ??? (missing) ❌

After:
  DATABASE_URL_MARQUE_KG → Railway DB ✅
  DATABASE_URL_MARQUE_US → Railway DB ✅ (same one!)
```

Now **all users** (KG + US) go to the **same Railway database**!

---

## 🧪 Test It

After Railway deploys:

```bash
# Test authentication
python3 test_auth_flow_complete.py

# Check database (User 19 should appear!)
python3 check_railway_user_19.py
```

---

## ✅ Expected Result
