## 🧪 TDD Workflow for Each Phase

### Red → Green → Refactor Cycle

1. **RED: Write Failing Tests**

   ```python
   def test_dashboard_shows_total_orders_today(self, admin_client):
       """Dashboard should show total orders count for today"""
       response = admin_client.get("/admin/")
       assert "Total Orders Today" in response.text
       assert "5" in response.text  # Assuming 5 orders today
   ```

2. **GREEN: Implement Minimum Code to Pass**

   ```python
   class DashboardView(BaseView):
       async def index(self, request):
           orders_today = db.query(Order).filter(
               Order.order_date >= datetime.today()
           ).count()
           return templates.TemplateResponse("dashboard.html", {
               "orders_today": orders_today
           })
   ```

3. **REFACTOR: Improve Code Quality**
   - Extract to service methods
   - Add caching if needed
   - Optimize queries
   - Add documentation
