# 🚀 START HERE - Product Model Improvements

## Quick Answer to Your Question ❓

**You asked:** "I don't have a price column - is this wrong?"

**Answer:** **NO! Your structure is CORRECT!** ✅

You're using a professional **multi-variant system** where each SKU (size/color combination) has its own price. This is the RIGHT way to build e-commerce!

```
Product (Nike Air Max)
└── SKU 1: Size 40, Black → 5000 сом
└── SKU 2: Size 41, Black → 5000 сом
└── SKU 3: Size 40, White → 5500 сом
└── SKU 4: Size 41, White → 5500 сом

Display: "от 5000 сом" (minimum price)
```
