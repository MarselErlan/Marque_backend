# 🚂 Railway Setup - Find User ID 19

## ✅ What We Know

Your test worked perfectly:

```
✅ User ID: 19 (+13128059851)
✅ is_active: True
✅ is_verified: True
✅ All tests passed: 100%
```

But you can't see User 19 in Railway dashboard because:

**You're viewing the KG database, but User 19 is in the US database!**

---

## 📊 Your Database Setup

Your application needs **TWO database URLs**:

```bash
# KG Market Database
DATABASE_URL_MARQUE_KG = postgresql://postgres:...@metro.proxy.rlwy.net:45504/railway
  ├── User 3: +996700123456 ✅ (you see this)
  └── User 4: +996700234567 ✅ (you see this)

# US Market Database
DATABASE_URL_MARQUE_US = postgresql://postgres:...@??????/??????
  └── User 19: +13128059851 ❓ (WHERE IS THIS?)
```

---

## 🎯 Two Possible Scenarios

### Scenario A: You Have 2 Separate Postgres Services (Recommended)

In Railway dashboard, you should see:

```
Your Project
├── marquebackend (App)
├── PostgreSQL (KG) ← You're viewing this one
└── PostgreSQL (US) ← User 19 is here!
```

**Action:** Click on the **second PostgreSQL service** to view User 19

---

### Scenario B: Both Using Same Database (Current Setup)

Both `DATABASE_URL_MARQUE_KG` and `DATABASE_URL_MARQUE_US` point to the same database URL.

In this case, **User 19 should be in the same database** you're viewing!

Let me verify this...

---

## 🔍 Let's Check Your Railway Environment

### Step 1: View Your Railway Variables

Go to Railway Dashboard:

1. https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Click your project: **marque_db_kg** or similar
3. Click on your **App Service** (marquebackend)
4. Click **Variables** tab

You should see:

```
DATABASE_URL_MARQUE_KG = postgresql://...
DATABASE_URL_MARQUE_US = postgresql://...   ← Do you have this?
```

---

## ✅ Fix Option 1: If You DON'T Have `DATABASE_URL_MARQUE_US`

This means your app is using the same database for both markets!

### Add the Variable:

1. In Railway Variables, click **New Variable**
2. Set:

   ```
   Name: DATABASE_URL_MARQUE_US
   Value: ${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}
   ```

   (This references your existing Postgres)

3. **Redeploy** your app

Now **User 19 should appear** in the same database!

---

## ✅ Fix Option 2: If You HAVE `DATABASE_URL_MARQUE_US` But It's Different

This means you have 2 separate databases.

### Find the US Database:

1. In Railway project view, look for **2 PostgreSQL services**
2. Click the one you haven't been viewing
3. Go to **Data** tab
4. Click **users** table
5. You should see **User 19**!

---

## 🧪 Quick Test: Check If Same Database

Run this to see if both URLs are the same:

```bash
# In Railway Variables tab, copy both URLs and compare:

DATABASE_URL_MARQUE_KG:
postgresql://postgres:YgyDmMbYyzPKvSsNyDRShLJqehXtTdJx@metro.proxy.rlwy.net:45504/railway

DATABASE_URL_MARQUE_US:
postgresql://postgres:YgyDmMbYyzPKvSsNyDRShLJqehXtTdJx@metro.proxy.rlwy.net:45504/railway
                                                        ^^^ Same? ^^^
```

If they're **identical**: User 19 is in the same database!
If they're **different**: User 19 is in a separate database!

---

## 🎯 Most Likely: You Need to Add `DATABASE_URL_MARQUE_US`

Based on your test succeeding against production, but you can't see User 19, here's what probably happened:

1. ✅ Your **local test** used `DATABASE_URL_MARQUE_US` from your `.env`
2. ❌ Your **Railway app** doesn't have `DATABASE_URL_MARQUE_US` set
3. ✅ So it falls back to **default** or creates User 19 in memory (ephemeral)

### Fix:

Add this to Railway Variables:

```
DATABASE_URL_MARQUE_US = ${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}
```

Then redeploy!

---

## 📝 Recommended Railway Setup

For **production-ready** multi-market support:

### Option A: Single Database (Simpler)

```
Variables:
  DATABASE_URL_MARQUE_KG = ${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}
  DATABASE_URL_MARQUE_US = ${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}
```

Both markets use the same database. Users distinguished by `phone_number` prefix.

**Pros:**

- ✅ Simple
- ✅ One database to manage
- ✅ All users in one place

**Cons:**

- ❌ Can't scale markets independently
- ❌ Backup/restore affects both markets

---

### Option B: Separate Databases (Better for Scale)

```
Services:
  1. PostgreSQL (KG)
  2. PostgreSQL (US)

Variables:
  DATABASE_URL_MARQUE_KG = ${{PostgreSQL_KG.DATABASE_URL}}
  DATABASE_URL_MARQUE_US = ${{PostgreSQL_US.DATABASE_URL}}
```

Each market has its own database.

**Pros:**

- ✅ Independent scaling
- ✅ Market-specific backups
- ✅ Better for compliance (GDPR, data residency)

**Cons:**

- ❌ More complex
- ❌ Two databases to manage
- ❌ Higher cost

---

## 🚀 Quick Action Plan

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**

   - Check Variables tab
   - Look for `DATABASE_URL_MARQUE_US`

2. **If Missing:**

   ```
   Add: DATABASE_URL_MARQUE_US = ${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}
   ```

3. **Redeploy App**

4. **Test Again:**

   ```bash
   python3 test_auth_flow_complete.py
   ```

5. **Check Database:**
   ```bash
   python3 check_railway_user_19.py
   ```

You should now see **User 19**!

## ❓ Still Can't Find User 19?

Share these details:

1. **From Railway Variables tab:**

   ```
   DATABASE_URL_MARQUE_KG = ?
   DATABASE_URL_MARQUE_US = ? (exists or not?)
   ```

2. **From Railway project view:**
   - How many PostgreSQL services do you see?

And I'll help you find it! 🎯

**Issue:** User 19 not visible in Railway dashboard  
**Cause:** Missing or different `DATABASE_URL_MARQUE_US`  
**Solution:** Configure US database URL in Railway
