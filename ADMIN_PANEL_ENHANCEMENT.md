# Admin Panel Enhancement Summary

## ✅ Completed Enhancements

### Product Admin Views Enhancement

Based on analysis of the `Product` model, the following fields have been added to admin views:

#### 1. **List View (`column_list`)**

Added to product list view:

- ✅ `season` - Season of the product (Winter, Summer, etc.)
- ✅ `material` - Material of the product (Cotton, Polyester, etc.)
- ✅ `style` - Style of the product (Casual, Formal, etc.)
- ✅ `is_featured` - Whether product is featured on homepage

**Complete List View Columns:**

```python
column_list = [
    "id", "title", "brand", "category", "subcategory",
    "season", "material", "style",
    "sold_count", "rating_avg", "is_active", "is_featured"
]
```

#### 2. **Detail View (`column_details_list`)**

Added to product detail view:

- ✅ `season` - Season with full relationship display
- ✅ `material` - Material with full relationship display
- ✅ `style` - Style with full relationship display
- ✅ `is_featured` - Featured status
- ✅ `attributes` - JSON attributes field

**Complete Detail View Columns:**

```python
column_details_list = [
    "id", "brand", "category", "subcategory",
    "season", "material", "style",
    "title", "slug", "description",
    "sold_count", "rating_avg", "rating_count",
    "is_active", "is_featured", "attributes",
    "created_at", "updated_at",
    "skus", "assets", "reviews"
]
```

#### 3. **Column Formatters**

Added formatters for better display:

```python
"season": lambda model, _: model.season.name if model.season else "-",
"material": lambda model, _: model.material.name if model.material else "-",
"style": lambda model, _: model.style.name if model.style else "-",
```

These formatters:

- Display the name of the related object
- Show "-" if the field is empty/null
- Gracefully handle optional relationships

#### 4. **Column Labels**

Added Russian labels for all new fields:

```python
"season": "Сезон",
"material": "Материал",
"style": "Стиль",
```

#### 5. **Column Descriptions**

All fields already had proper descriptions from previous updates.
