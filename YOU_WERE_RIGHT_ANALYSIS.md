## 📈 FINAL NUMBERS

### Before Your Question:

- **Models I knew about:** 18
- **Models Enhanced:** 7
- **Total Indexes:** 26
- **Total Methods:** 35

- **Models Enhanced:** 18 (+ 11 more!)
- **Total Indexes:** 54+ (+ 28 more!)
- **Total Methods:** 70+ (+ 35 more!)

---

## 🎯 WHY I MISSED THEM

1. **ProductAsset** - I looked at Product model but didn't check related models
2. **ProductAttribute** - Didn't explore the full products/ directory
3. **ProductFilter.py** - This file has **6 models** in one file! Easy to miss
4. **CartOrder** - Thought it was the same as Cart
5. **Admin models** - Didn't check the subdirectories in admins/

**Lesson:** Always check EVERY file, not just the main models!
